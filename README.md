# Battleship
This is an implementation of the Battleship game in Python, featuring two levels of AI and a two-player option. 
It uses the Hasbro ships from https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battleship_(game), with the classic rules: upon hitting a ship it announces it's name, and announces when it is sunk. Please find implementation details in the comments.

## To Run
run ```python main.py``` 

This was tested using python 3.11.0
